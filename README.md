# Project Description

A user interface application developed using OpenCV and Tinkter that helps to monitor the medical condition of ankylosing spondylitis.
The application uses keypoints detection (HRNet) and image classification (ResNet152) to achieve the outcome.
Keypoints detection uses points to crop and horizontally aligned the area of interest for standardised classification.
Users are able to manipulate and change the predictions as necessary through the application.
The application could also save and collate edited annotations made by user for future fine-tunning and improvement of models.
